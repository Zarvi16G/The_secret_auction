The Secret Auction is my personal project using dictionaries to create an online platform. It lets users bid on items while keeping their identities secret. It's easy to use, and participants can bid without revealing who they are until the auction ends. With a variety of items available, The Secret Auction offers a fun way for buyers to get great deals while staying anonymous.

Usage
